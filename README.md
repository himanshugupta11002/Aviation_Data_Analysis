Airline passenge Satisfaction

# INTRODUCTION 

In today's fast-paced world, air travel has become an integral part of our lives. Millions of passengers fly across the globe every day, making the airline industry one of the largest and most competitive sectors. Ensuring high passenger satisfaction is not only a priority but also a key factor for the success of airlines. Satisfied passengers are more likely to become loyal customers and advocate for the airline. However, understanding the complex factors that influence passenger satisfaction can be challenging. This project aims to unravel the mystery behind airline passenger satisfaction by leveraging data analytics and machine learning.

# ABOUT THE PROJECT

In this comprehensive analysis, we dive deep into the world of airline passenger satisfaction. We explore the various aspects that contribute to passenger contentment or discontentment and seek to identify critical factors that airlines can focus on to improve the overall passenger experience. Our project encompasses the following key objectives:

1. Identifying Correlated Factors: We aim to identify the factors that are strongly correlated with overall passenger satisfaction. This involves analyzing attributes such as gender, customer type, age, travel purpose, travel class, and more.

2. Predicting Future Satisfaction: We'll employ machine learning models to predict passenger satisfaction based on the provided data. This predictive capability can help airlines anticipate and address potential satisfaction issues proactively.

3. Recommendations for Improvement: Armed with insights from our analysis, we'll provide actionable recommendations to airlines, suggesting areas for improvement and strategies to enhance passenger satisfaction.

Our approach combines exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling to gain a comprehensive understanding of passenger satisfaction in the airline industry.

# DATA OVERVIEW

The Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset used for this project is a valuable resource containing information on the satisfaction levels of airline passengers. It is divided into two parts, one for training our models and the other for testing. The complete dataset consists of 129,880records and 25 columns, one of which is obsolete and will be removed (Unknown 0--->> a duplicate of the index). Here is an overview of the dataset columns:
